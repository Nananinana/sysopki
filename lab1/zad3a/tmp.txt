< I propose to consider the question, "Can machines think?" This should begin with definitions of
< the meaning of the terms "machine" and "think." The definitions might be framed so as to
< reflect so far as possible the normal use of the words, but this attitude is dangerous. If the
< meaning of the words "machine" and "think" are to be found by examining how they are
< commonly used it is difficult to escape the conclusion that the meaning and the answer to the
< question, "Can machines think?" is to be sought in a statistical survey such as a Gallup poll. But
< this is absurd. Instead of attempting such a definition I shall replace the question by another,
< which is closely related to it and is expressed in relatively unambiguous words.
< The new form of the problem can be described in terms of a game which we call the "imitation
< game." It is played with three people, a man (A), a woman (B), and an interrogator (C) who may
< be of either sex. The interrogator stays in a room apart from the other two. The object of the
< game for the interrogator is to determine which of the other two is the man and which is the
< woman. He knows them by labels X and Y, and at the end of the game he says either "X is A
< and Y is B" or "X is B and Y is A." The interrogator is allowed to put questions to A and B
< thus:
< C: Will X please tell me the length of his or her hair?

> Th e “demarcation problem,” the issue of how to separate science from pseudoscience,
