> Th e “demarcation problem,” the issue of how to separate science from pseudoscience,
> has been around since fall 1919—at least according to Karl Popper’s
> (1957) recollection of when he fi rst started thinking about it. In Popper’s
> mind, the demarcation problem was intimately linked with one of the most
> vexing issues in philosophy of science, David Hume’s problem of induction
> (Vickers 2010) and, in particular, Hume’s contention that induction cannot
> be logically justifi ed by appealing to the fact that “it works,” as that in itself is
> an inductive argument, thereby potentially plunging the philosopher straight
> into the abyss of a viciously circular argument.
> Popper famously thought he had solved both the demarcation and induction
> problems in one fell swoop, by invoking falsifi cation as the criterion that
> separates science from pseudoscience. Not only, according to Popper, do scientifi
> c hypotheses have to be falsifi able (while pseudoscientifi c ones are not),
> but since falsifi cation is an application of modus tollens, and hence a type of
> deductive thinking, we can get rid of induction altogether as the basis for scientifi
> c reasoning and set Hume’s ghost to rest once and for all.
